GitHub is where people build software. 
More than 11 million people use GitHub 
to discover, fork, and contribute to over 
29 million projects.

Now I have come to my last year of primary school, 
when I look back on the passed days, 
I feel that I have grown up.
I learn to help my mother with her housework,
because I want to relieve her burden. 
When my fathers comes home after work, 
I show him all the things happen at school,
I want him to know everything about me.
This is the best me. 
现在来到我小学的最后一年,
当我回首过去的日子,
我觉得我已经长大了。
我学会了帮助我妈妈做家务,
因为我想减轻她的负担。
当我爸爸下班回家了,
我给他讲述所有发生在学校的事情,
我想让他知道我的一切。
这是最好的我。
